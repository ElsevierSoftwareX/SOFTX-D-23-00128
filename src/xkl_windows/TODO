				TO DO
======================================================================

- ask seth to create mail alias xkl, xkldev so people can send bug
  reports, etc., via email

- Makefiles
  - verify that it is consistent across subdirectories
  - verify that method works for all dirs across all platforms

- Doc
  - Add man page for xkl, lspecto, syn
  - [Helen] Finish HTML page describing what different programs do, and 
    how to use them (software.html)

- General
  - *** Do byte swapping in a smart manner (SWAP).  Always write in certain 
    format (e.g. big endian (same as Network order)), but decide when to
    do byte-swapping based on architecture:
      short i = 1;
      bigendian = (*((unsigned char*) (&i)) == 1);
      if (!bigendian) swapShort(wave);
  - ** Add LinuxPPC as a platform (need to install on a Mac)
  - Prettify code and make more readable for:
    xklsyn.h, xspec_util.h, xkl.c, xklspec.c, xspec_util.c, 
    syn.c, synparwav.c, syngrid.c, synscrip.c
  - Make xkl, lspecto, syn code more modular
    - Get rid of most globals, e.g. warning popup dialogs
  - Make windowing and fft functions common, e.g. lspecto and xkl use
    the same functions rather than having their own versions

- Recording
  - recording works, but has no real user interface
    - recording popup window, with user controls, etc.

- Postscript output
  - *** need to have eps as an option, for postscript that can be edited, 
    e.g., using Illustrator (these files will be limited to one page)
  - Make postscript output go through single function(s) for
    consistency -- create postscript routines in common

- syn (LOW priority)
  - Clean up of syn code, e.g. remove copystring, mergestring
  - Incorporate getargs -- argument processing
  - smarter reading of .doc files -- not based on spaces
  - Fix the need for an extra carriage return under Linux (other 
	platforms?)

- lspecto
  - Needs major cleanup of code
  - Incorporate getargs -- argument processing

- xkl
  - *** Don't save .gram files when calculating spectrograms
  - *** colormap and background for spectrogram and spectrum (?) (xinfo.c and
    xinfo.h) - blue background on certain displays
  - *** residual synthesis problems:
    - After synthesizing a file, prompts for .doc file name, but should
      just use root of .wav file and tack .doc on to it.
    - After synthesizing, crashes when user chooses "use current display"
    - incorporate 'klsynah', which includes parameters aht (first difference
      in %) and ahm (modulation of AH in %)
    - Sure there are many other bugs, but hasn't been stable enough to
      find them
  - *** change DFT size so can have 44 kHz with 25.6 ms window
    - Increase D to 2048.  Look into error message for num points 
      greater than 2048.
  - ** Saving waveform or .ps files: allow user to choose
    the directory (as we can for loading files). It should be the
    same directory that was last used for saving that kind of file, 
    not for loading (we may want to load from one directory, but write to 
    another, or write particular kinds of files to different directories)
  - * 's' command: need to be able to view two superimposed smoothed spectra 
    from two different files.
  - * Change 'A' to work across waveforms. Change interface to use a 
    list of times.
  - * Spectra for k, a, A: don't put in smoothed spectra
  - * Incorporation of some lspecto functions into xkl, e.g. view formant or 
    pitch tracks on the screen, lined up under the waveform, or superimposed 
    on the spectrogram.  
  - * Import label files from ToBI.
  - * Add ability to change spectrogram parameters in xkl (currently have
    to change xkldefs.dat file and recalculate spectrogram)
  - * ``lock''ing waveforms: remaining issues.
    - In time menu change ``lock ... (NA)'' to ``Lock waveforms''; ditto 
      for ``Unlock''.
    - Might want the spectra of the locked waveforms to be automatically 
      overlaid. We could have the option of just normal spectrum displays 
      or overlays of the spectra of the locked waveforms at the current 
      time. Do we want the overlays in the current windows, or do we want a 
      new window to come up specifically for the overlaid spectra?
    - If only two waveforms are open, those two should be locked
      by default (i.e. no need to prompt user with popup menu)
    - When there are more than two, it would be nice to be able to choose 
      them from the keyboard, using numbers (e.g. see how the 'n' command 
      works. One choice should be to select all of the waveforms.
    - Some kind of indicator that a waveform is locked would be nice
      (maybe something in the titlebar).
    - Right now 'L' locks and 'U' unlocks; maybe we could use just
      'L' as a toggle.
    - When taking measures from a spectrum or waveform, maybe the
      data from all of the locked waveforms should be presented.
  - synthesizer front-end could use big overhaul in future
  - When saving files, e.g. 'save w->e', the default filename is not
    'selected' in the popup window, so it's not so convenient if the user 
    wants to use a different name.
  - Ability to undo the most recent addition to a .ps file
  - Add "Save as" in xkl (so can, e.g., save Klatt .wav file as MS wav)
  - Use param struct for all menus, spectrum parameters
  - Change help.h.
  - variable size spectrograms (i.e. windows can be resized)
  - when click in spectrum window, it says   
    lala spectrum:	625 Hz	59.5 dB
    previous:		625 Hz	45.5 dB
    even though previous corresponds to DFT. So, change previous to
    appropriate signal type.
  - In C command, move S, w, D (?? not sure what this one is about)
  - Modify how xkl reads in files based on size of file -- if file is
    huge (e.g. 20MB), then read portion of file and display only that
    section, and as user advances in file, goto disk and get more
    data.
  - Add ability to read in .aiff and MS .wav formats
  - Add ability to change Gain within w->e (similar to klgain).
  - Add ability to do remote play
  - add check for environment variable, e.g. XKL_HOME, which would
    contain the default files for a user (e.g. spectrogram or spectrum).
  - Change DATE and VERSION in xspec_util.h (for every release)
  - The ``write spectrum file'' (W) command only writes the smoothed
    spectrum (specto) values.  Instead we would like to get the values for
    whatever type of spectrum is displayed in the spectrum window, including
    DFT point, frequency, and amplitude values.  There are currently
    two commands that print some of this information to the screen. 'O'
    gives DFT point, frequency, and bandwidth.  'V' gives DFT point
    and amplitude, but only of the smoothed spectra, NOT of the DFT.
    The screen displays can be copied to a file and then processed to get
    the information that we want.  However, we still wouldn't have the DFT
    amplitudes.
  - Changes are needed to the journal file (better format and more
    meaningful headings).
  - Some users would like to have window 1 rescaled based on
    the amplitude of the waveform portion that it holds (as happens in
    klspec).  However, other users don't like that feature, so we
    would like it be optional in xkl, with the default being that
    rescaling is off
  - history file, recording all commands and any feedback
  - iconize all windows simultaneously
  - A command to restore (all?) windows to their original size and location.
  - Make size of {\bf f} and {\bf b} commands variable
  - We might want some way to save a record of parameter values used
    for a session.  The current method of saving parameters to files that
    can be reloaded doesn't label the parameters.  (Could incorporate 
    into .wav format, i.e. save last set of parameters used for a
    waveform in its header).
  - x command to set duration in time of windows 1 and 0.
  - X command to set low/high frequency of spectrum window.
  - [Helen] Documentation: hard copy (see Dennis's in old_klatt_files), 
    web pages, some kind of help function in xkl

- waveio
  - verify code to read and save MS .wav format, and .aiff format
    - Note: has already been coded in wavio.c, but has not been tested
      or implemented in any of the programs.

- utils ( *** see below)
  - write C program klconvert to convert to/from Klatt wav format to
    aiff, MS wav, ulaw. Should use internal read/write routines vs. 
    using sox.
    - *** Should replace ms2kl, kl2ms, kl2mac, mac2kl scripts which 
      currently use sox
    - Create kl2mu and mu2kl (and man pages, and html file)
  - Remove sgikl2sd (???)
  - have ability to record from a DAT player into a Kl .wav format
  - have ability to play waveform segment, e.g. klplay -r .004:.01 a
  - for klplay and klrecord, check sampling rate and tell user if
    not same as requested
  - Add swap flag to kl2raw, raw2kl, sd2kl, kl2sd

- Wave audio
  - change play and record on SGI to use iocntl calls
  - have alternative for playing 16bit on 8bit audio

- Other klatt-tool-related projects
  - *** port (new)maketape to unix/linux (or to Mac if we can have seamless 
    access to Unix partitions).
  - Revamp of process; maybe include SR conversion, other kinds of filters, 
    better filter
  - KlattTalk
  - Harsyn
  - Transf
  - Maeda program

- xkl-web (This was Vishal's pet project; can be ignored for now)
  - ps fonts do not seem to translate using ghostscript-- 
  - allow command-line entering for type of
       output desired- spectrum, spectro,etc.
  - interface with perl scripts in xkl/web/www directory.
