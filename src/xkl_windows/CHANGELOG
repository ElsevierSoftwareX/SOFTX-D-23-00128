xkl v3.2  02/20/23 ldn
- general: 
  - Code clean up to make it compatible with windows
  - Bug fixes 

xkl v3.1  06/25/02 mkt
- xkl:
  - fix null selection bug when loading labels from file

xkl v3.0  06/07/02 mkt
- xkl:
  - new dialogs to change spectrum and spectrogram parameters
  - support for user labelling
  - support for cursor tracking
  - wide range of bug fixes

xkl v2.91 10/24/01 mkt
- xkl:
  - fix overwrite warnings synthesis bugs

xkl v2.9 09/14/01 mkt
- xkl:
  - sound now interruptible
  - additional label import options
  - "Change All" bug fix
- concat:
  - number of output samples overrun fix

xkl v2.8 09/15/00 mkt
- xkl script:  
  - bug fixes (-n arg now passed correctly all platforms) 
  - added [-l] display CHANGELOG option
- xkl:
  - spectrogram *finally* displays correctly regardless of screen depth
  - label support extended to *.LABEL files

xkl v2.7 08/23/00 mkt
- xkl:
  - a start at label support:  new File option to read and display LAFF landmark label files

xkl v2.6 08/17/00 mkt
- makefile structure reorganized to simplify multi-platform development:
    now loads platform specific data from Makefile.${PLATFORM}
- new xkl script controls user-tailored version to execute
- xkl:
  - spectrogram now displayed in current device depth.  This solves 'blue screen'
	problem, but some platforms show colors instead of grays (colormap mismatch
	on saturation?)
  - de/activateMenuItem now applies to all waveforms, not just current.  This allows
	printing from multiple waveform sources to same PS file.  Also set menu item
	sensitivity from currently open waveforms (same reason).

xkl v2.51 06/07/00 mkt
- added Xp to XTRA_LIBS in Makefile.vars for RH Linux distributions
- put CHANGELOG, TODO, Makefile, Makefile.vars under RCS
- xkl:
  - writegram stubbed to prevent gram file writes
  - byte-swapping on big-endian machines is now inferred 
	(-s argument inverts default behavior on any platform)
  - .doc files get default name from .wav file in synthesis

xkldev directory reorganization 5/30/00 mkt
  ~/xkl/xkl-2.5/* renamed to ~/dev/*  

xkl v.2.5 4/20/00
- Added man pages for utils
- Added reading/writing MS .wav and .aiff 

- xkl:
  - File selection box remembers current directory
  - "n" function allows for number of waveform to be pressed
  - all oops messages => use ShowOops
  - auto selected text in dialog boxes to allow for
       continuous typing
  - after out-of-range box comes up from an input dialog,
       the input dialog now remains for re-entering a new value
  - lock/unlock is fully functional.
  -   "lock"- provides a dialog to select which waveforms to be
  -           locked.  currently locked waveforms are highlighted.
  -   "unlock" - unlocks all waveforms.

  - Synthesis
	- problems with synthesis funtion remedied
	- instability when using certain functions seems to be removed
	- better cross-machine compatibility	
	- synthesis and save works-- calls up dialogs for both functions

- xkl-web:
  - uses stripped down, modified xkl.c and xspec_util.c in xkl/web/ directory
  - draws either a spectrum (of arbitrary type) or a spectrogram
      to a jpg file.  As argument takes the waveform name.  
  - uses gs to convert ps->jpg (better way?)


xkl v.2.4 7/17/98

- General:
  - Put all code into RCS.
  - Added README to tell how to compile programs.
  - Reorganized file structures -- put syn, lspecto, utils in separate
    directories.
  - Cleaned up concat.c, wave_util.c, wave_util.h, raw2kl.c,
    kl2raw.c, xinfo.c, xinfo.h, resources.h, xklspec.h, wavinfo.c
  - removed sgikl2sd and deckl2sd, and using kl2sd instead

- Makefiles:
  - Modified the top level makefile
  - Created cleaner makefiles.
  - Created Imakefile for xkl.
  - Simplified Makefile to use "include ../Makefile.vars", which 
    contains global variables.

- xkl:
  - Add RCS header for xkl files
  - Added ability to change spectrum parameters for current waveform or 
    all loaded waveforms.
  - Added turning on/off menu items that allowed user to save
    spectrum/window to file based on if postscript file is open.
  - Moved syn front-end in xkl.c to bottom
  - Modified to allow user to not open another window when they save a
    w->e .wav file.
  - Changed some of the menu item labels to be more understandable.
  - Change where xkl look for lib files by using -DXKLIBDIR=${LIBDIR}
    in Makefile.
  - Deleted extra 'showpage' from fullpage postscript file, that caused
    an extra blank page to be output.
  - Changed AVGLIMIT, the maximum # of points that can be averaged
    using 'A', to 100.
  - Changed "D Delete .wav file" to "D Close .wav file" per Adrienne's
    request:  Also the command under File menu that is Delete the
    waveform might be clearer if it was Delete waveform from window or
    something that made it clear the original file would not be
    deleted completely.  
  - Fixed: if zero amplitude wave file, then xkl no crashes.
  - Fixed: Hamming window not drawn when after loading a waveform
    using 'v' and starting with 'xkl -n'
  - Change points[512] in draw_hamm to [2048] so we can display 44kHz
    signals. 
  - Major cleaning/prettifying of postscript outputs
  - Fixed: I figured out why we are getting that blank page at the end
    of  xkl 'G' .ps files: there is an extra 'showpage' at the end of
    the file. (Helen)
  - Fixed: Erika saved some spectra to a .ps file, and then it
    wouldn't print.  It turned out that there wasn't a showpage at the
    end.  I suspect that she didn't close the .ps file before quiting
    xkl, and then xkl doesn't tie up the loose ends.  Either it should
    close up the files, or ask the user if it is OK to do so.  By
    close up, I mean doing whatever it does before closing the file,
    e.g. add a showpage. (Helen)
  - Changed to prettier fonts (emulates Netscape fonts).
  - Moved FREQ (kHz) in spectrogram postscript file.
  - Fixed 4 dB offset of spectrum in postscript printouts
  - help pulldown menu data in xkl is now in a separate file, help.h.

- wavio:
  - Added getargs to code.  Contains IsArg, checkIntArg, etc. for
    parsing args passed to programs.
  - Created functions for opening, reading and writing .wav headers
    and waveforms.
  - Changed name of waveio.c to wavio.c.
  - Created checkWavName in wavio.c, which checks if a wave file
    exists, and if it does, prompts user for another filename.
  - Added checks for ERRORs in opening, reading, and closing wavefiles.

- lspecto
  - Cleaned up postscript output -- no longer clips images, overwrites
    text.
  - Modified where it looks for default file -- it now looks
    in XKLDIR, which is defined in the Makefile.

- syn
  - Modified where it looks for default file -- it now looks
    in XKLDIR, which is defined in the Makefile.

- wav audio:
  - Created play and record functions, and incorporated them into
    wavplay, wavrecord and xkl.

- utils:
  - cleaned and commented scripts, e.g. kl2sd, sd2kl, matlab scripts
  - Changed names of wavinfo wavplay, etc. to use kl prefix to 
    prevent clashes with MS .wav format.
  - Created klinfo, klgain, klplay, klrecord, ms2kl, kl2ms, 
    mac2kl, kl2mac.
  - Changed MAXWAVEFORMS to 100 in concat.
  - Added checkWavName to concat, wavrecord.
  - put in the ability to record at different sampling rates and
    durations, for wavrecord
  - added pause in klplay for playing multiple wavefiles
  - Added flags to klinfo to print out only sampling rate, num
    samples, etc.
  - Made 75% info for klgain, and checkin.
  - Modified to use getargs.
