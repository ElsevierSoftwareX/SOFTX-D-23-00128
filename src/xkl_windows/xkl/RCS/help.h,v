"GENERAL INFO:\n",
"	The xkl program displays information about a given waveform\n",
" in as many as four graphics windows, and is capable of displaying\n",
" several different waveforms at once.  Each waveform has its own spectrum\n",
" and spectrogram windows, and two waveform windows.\n\n",
"	Each of the graphics windows reacts to\n", 
"user input it receives when it has the focus of attention (The program\n",
"indicates which window is active by changing the border color).\n",
" NOTE: Pointer mode makes it difficult to use the keyboard only.\n",
"  The pointer location overrides other types of window selection.\n",
"	The text window does not accept any commands.  Note that\n",
"it does not have any menus.  It is there to provide the user\n",
"with a history of the actions taken in the program.  Text from the\n",
"can be pasted into an input popup window.\n\n",
"	Although each of the graphics windows handles its own\n",
"input through its menus, much of the time this will be transparent to\n",
"the user through the use of accelerators and because many of the\n",
"windows respond in the same way to a menu selection.  An accelerator is\n",
"a single character associated with a menu item that has the effect of\n",
"selecting that entry from a menu when it is entered from the keyboard\n",
"There is no need to pull down the menu.  If any one of the four\n",
"graphics waveform windows has the focus of attention and the user enters\n",
"'t', an popup window appears and the user is expected to enter a time\n",
"in ms.  Until the user enters a time or chooses cancel, all of the xkl\n",
"windows except the text window (and of course the popup) do not process\n",
"any user requests.  Holding down the ALT key while pressing the first\n", 
"(lower case) letter of the menu brings down that menu\n",
"so it can be read.\n\n",  
"     There are some menu items that behave differently depending\n",
"on which window is active.  For example, saving a full-page image of a\n",
"window to a postscript file requires that that window has the focus\n",
"of attention when the command is invoked. \n\n",
"     The commands G, g, and H open global files in which data\n",
"from any waveform can be stored.  The character `*' stores a full-page\n",
"image of a window into a file opened by `G', `#' stores spectra four-to-\n",
"a page in a file opened by `g', and `h' stores spectrum or waveform\n",
"amplitude data in a file opened with the `H' command\n\n",
"	 When either play is selected from the Commands window (the \n",
"accelerator is 'p') or the middle mouse button is pushed, the selected\n",
"region of the waveform is played.  `P' plays the entire waveform. \n\n",
"DISPLAYING SPECTRA FROM TWO DIFFERENT FILES IN SAME WINDOW:\n\n",
"	The xkl program has a spectrum window for each waveform so\n",
"so at present the display of spectra from two different files in the\n",
"same spectrum window is handled differently than it is in KLspec.  \n",
"The user can write a spectrum file ('z'), which is an ascii file of the\n",
"values of the smoothed spectrum in the spectrum window.  The user can then\n",
"use 'Z' to read this file into xkl and display it in the spectrum window\n", 
"of another waveform for comparison.  This feature is only available\n",
"in `s' or  `smoothed spectrum' mode.\n\n",
"WINDOW SIZES and LOCATIONS:\n",

"COPYING FROM F+BW WINDOW:\n",
"       The 'O' command writes to the screen and not to a file\n",
"but it is easy to cut and paste the information into a file,\n",
"especially with version 19.19 of emacs.  Use kill-rectangle and\n",
"yank-rectangle in emacs if you need to rearrange the columns.\n\n",
"THE PARAMETERS WINDOW:\n",
	"When the user selects 'Change param. value' from the Options\n",
"menu(`C') a window with a list of the parameters pops up.  There are three\n",
"ways to select the parameter that you want to change.  If you click\n",
"with the right mouse button on an entry in the list (motif will highlight\n",
"it for you) and click on change, the input popup will appear and you can\n", 
"change the value.  Double clicking on a list entry eliminates the need\n",
"for clicking on `change'.  You can also choose the parameter you want to\n",
"change by typing the single character associated with the parameter\n",
"in the 'SYM' column.\n\n",
"THE INPUT POPUP:\n\n",
"	This little window pops up when the xkl program wants\n",
"input from the user.  You may use the tab and arrow keys to move\n",
"the focus from the buttons to the text area.  This applies to the\n",
"file browser as well.  Tab moves to a different part of the window,\n",
"for example from the text part to the button part and the arrow keys\n",
"move the focus to the different buttons.  Of course clicking with the\n",
"mouse moves focus as well.  You might want to enter your\n",
"new value by just hitting return in the text area.  This will\n", 
"leave text area selected so next time you use the input popup\n",
"the text area is already selected and you can just start typing.\n\n",
"NOTE: the input popup stops all activity in the graphics windows\n",
"until you enter a value or cancel.  You may cut and paste from the\n",
"xkl textwindow and clicking in the textwindow raises the input popup\n",
"should it become buried under other windows.\n\n",
"SPECTROGRAMS:\n\n",
"	The ' xkl_defs.dat ' file controls spectrogram parameters.  It\n",
"must be named xkl_defs.dat and be in the directory that you run xkl from.\n",
"It is suggested that you change just the white and dark gray thresholds.\n",
"This file affects the SPECTROGRAM ONLY.\n",
"Cut and paste the following into a file called ' xkl_defs.dat ':\n\n",
"6.4     window in ms(padded with zeros for fft), default:6.4ms\n",
"128	number of samples in each fft(16,32,64,128,256,512), default:128\n",
"3	number of ffts averaged, default: 3\n",
"1.0   number of ms that each fft is offset from the previous one,default:1\n",
"700.0  total number of ms displayed in spectrogram, default:1300.0\n", 
"5.0     magnitudes < this mapped to white, default:5.0\n",
"25.0    magnitudes > this mapped to darkest gray, default:25.0\n",
"1       scale size of spectrogram(1 or 2), default:1 \n",
"100     0 = no pre-emphasis  100 = exact first difference, default:100\n",
"0       0 = x axis in milliseconds, 1 = x axis in seconds, default:0\n\n",
" A LARGER SPECTROGRAM for .ps files: you can 'set number of ffts averaged' to\n",
"1 or 2. This will make a spectrogram that is higher resolution for printing\n",
"however it will take several minutes to print(lspecto prints faster.)\n\n", 
"THE .PARAMS FILES:\n",
"     It is possible to store all the parameter values that you\n",
"can access with the 'C' command in a file and read them in\n",
"during another session.  The commands are 'm' to store the values\n",
"in a file and 'M' to retrieve them.  It is NOT RECOMMENDED that you\n",
"edit this file but rather write out a new one from the program where\n",
"the parameter values are checked against a valid range. \n",
"IMPORTANT NOTE: these parameters do not affect the spectrogram\n\n",
"OTHER KLATT TOOL PROGRAMS: lspecto, concat, syn, rawtowav. Type\n",
"program name with no arguments for usage.\n\n",
"DISPLAY F0:  Use lspecto -syn on the .wav file first, use the\n",
"synthesizer with that .doc file, then 'd' (time function F0) for a graph\n\n",
"SD TO WAV: It's hard to be sure what format an sd file is in but in\n",
"most cases this should work.  Running on a little endian machine like\n",
"lexic use:   sfconvert -o SHORT file.sd file.temp\n",
