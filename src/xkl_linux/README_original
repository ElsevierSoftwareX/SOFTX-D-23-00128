======================================================================

The programs and scripts consist of the following:

PROGS:  xkl
	lspecto
	syn
	concat, raw2kl, kl2raw, klinfo, klgain, klplay, klrecord

SCRIPTS: kl2sd, sd2kl, kl2sd, mac2kl, kl2mac, kl2ms, ms2kl
MATLAB:  mat2kl, kl2mat

======================================================================
			
BUILD:
------

1) Edit the Makefile.vars file, and specify the user defined variables
in the Makefile, uncomment out the library info based on the platform.

2b) To build individual programs only, go into the directory of
interest (e.g. cd lspecto), and do 'make; make install'.

OR

2a) To build all programs, in the top level xkl directory, type

unix> make
unix> make install

3) To install man pages, type

unix> make install.man


NOTES FOR BUILDING XKL:
-----------------------

- xkl requires Motif.
- The Makefile should work as is if you have X11 and Motif installed
  in the appropriate directories: 

/usr/X11/include   or /usr/include/X11
/usr/X11/lib	   or /usr/lib/X11

If you run into problems with 'make' when creating xkl, you have
several options:

1) If imake (especially the Motif component) is installed correctly,
then you can try 'xmkmf -a' in the xkl subdirectory.
2) Modify the Makefile in the xkl subdirectory in the section
corresponding to your platform.
3) Use Makefile.sav as the makefile:

unix> make -f Makefile.sav
unix> make -f Makefile.sav install

NOTES ABOUT SCRIPTS:
--------------------

Some of the scripts require additional programs.

sd2kl, kl2sd, deckl2sd, kl2sd require the ESPS program bhd.
kl2mac, mac2kl, kl2ms, ms2kl require sox (http://www.spies.com/Sox).
sox version 12.14 is known to work with these scripts.
