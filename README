The xkl software package is a speech processing tool originally developed by Dennis Klatt
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. The package combines in a single 
program the set of speech analysis and synthesis tools developed by Klatt, providing
a unified user interface based on Motif.

The current release is a port of the package to modern Operative Systems (OSes)
(macOs, linux, windows) carried out in the framework of a collaboration between 
MIT and Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.
More information on the project can be found at http://acts.ing.uniroma1.it/xkl.php
